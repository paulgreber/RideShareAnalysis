# Case Study - Cyclistic Ride Share Data

This document is created as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificateâ€™s Capstone Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate all the skills learned during the program and put them to use performing data analysis in a way that can be showcased as part of a portfolio of our accomplishments.

## Background

Cyclistic is a bike-share service operating a fleet of 5842 bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago.

Cyclistic categorized their riders in one of two categories:

* Casual riders who use single-ride passes or full-day passes
* Riders with annual memberships.

Cyclistic's financial analysts have concluded that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. As a result, the marketing team wants to create a marketing campaign designed to convert casual riders into annual members.

However, before the marketing campaign can be started, trends need to be identified in Cyclistic's historical bike trip data.

## Objective

Cyclistic intends to create a marketing campaign designed to convert casual riders into annual members.

To be able to do this effectively, the following actions will be performed:

* Historical bike trip data will be analyzed.
* Difference between casual riders and annual members need to be found.
* Trends in how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic will be identified.
* Suggestions will be provided to the marketing team on how to use this information.

## Preparation

### Data Source

Cyclistic is not a real company, however the data for this exercise is real and comes from company called Divvy, which is a real bike ride-share company that operates in Chicago.

The past twelve months of data (2022-04 to 2023-03) has been acquired from Divvy's severs located [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This data is made freely available under the following [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Each month of data is contained in it's own CSV file which will need to be merged together before the data can be analyzed.

It is expected that the data is free of bias and is credible, this is because the data comes from Divvy itself and not a third party.

### Privacy Issues

There should be no privacy issues in the data, as no names, credit card numbers or user ids are present. The data does contain a `ride_id` which is a unique random 16-character alpha-numeric string which acts as an identifier of the ride, however this does not relate to who actually took the ride.

What the data does contain is information related to:

* When a ride took place
* How long was the ride
* Where a ride took place
* What kind of bike was used
* If the user was a casual rider or an annual member

Based on this it appears that there will be many elements of the data that can be examined to determine what differences exist between casual riders and annual members.

## Data Processing

### Tools Used

Python will be used to process the data for analysis. Python was chosen because it contains a wide range of powerful tools (such as Pandas) that can easily clean and validate a large set of data.

### Data Integrity

The first way that the integrity of the data was checked for null values in the dataset. Doing this discovered that there were null values in much of the values, however these null values occurred only in the locational information. The choice was made to keep these entries in our dataset and only remove them when doing analysis related to the location of the rides.

The next way that the integrity of the data was analyzed was by looking for errors in the `started_at` and `ended_at` columns. These columns contained the dates and times that a ride took place. Any rows where a `ended_at` was earlier than a `started_at` were removed as this indicated an error occurred when recording the entry.

### Data Transformations

#### Ride Date and Time

A large portion of our analysis was going to be spent looking at when and for how long rides were taken. To do this several operations had to be performed.

First, the ride duration had to be calculated. This was done by subtracting the `started_at` from the `ended_at` and then returning the result as the number of elapsed minutes. These values were added to a newly created column called `ride_duration`.

Next, the day of the week and month were extracted from the `started_at` entry and used to create a `day_of_week` and `month` entries.

#### Ride Location

While the physical location of most of the rides were present, they are not terribly meaningful values when trying to determine trends in rider behavior. Therefor, the latitude and longitude of each ride (when available) was translated to it's corresponding neighborhood so that trends could be identified to determine which areas.

This translation was done by acquiring a [Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) the neighborhoods of Chicago from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Neighborhoods/bbvz-uum9). The file was opened with Geopandas (a Pandas extension library for working with geospatial data) which allowed the content of the shapefile to be worked with as a Pandas dataframe and also allows the shapefile to be drawn.

The data from the shapefile was then joined with the data from our main dataset, resulting in our main dataset containing the neighborhoods that each starting latitude and longitude existed in.

## Analysis

Analysis will attempt to answer the following questions:

* When are users riding?
* What are users riding?
* Where are users riding?

But before we begin, let's look at how many riders there are:

![Count of Annual Members vs Casual Riders](/analysis/count_annual_members_vs_casual_riders.png)
![Percent of Annual Members vs Casual Riders](/analysis/percent_member_vs_casual.png)

### When are Users Riding?

![Rider Count by Month](/analysis/rider_each_month.png)

The number of riders is lowest during the colder months and higher during the warm months. However during cold months, riders with an annual membership is still much higher than casual riders. But during the warm month (summer in particular) the number of casual riders increases to be almost equal with that the riders with annual memberships.

![Rider Count by Day of Week](/analysis/rider_day_of_week.png)

Riders with annual memberships is highest during the week, while casual riders is highest during the weekends.

![Rider Count by Time of Day](/analysis/rider_time_of_day.png)

All riders tend to ride most often in the afternoon and least often at night.

Casual riders tend to ride more in the evening than they do in the morning, while riders with annual memberships tend to ride as often in the mornings as they do in the evenings.

![Ride Duration](/analysis/ride_duration.png)

*Note that this plot is made with all outlying data removed*

On average, casual riders take slightly longer rides than riders with annual memberships.

### What are Users Riding?

![Bike Type by Membership](/analysis/bike_type_by_membership.png)

In general, casual riders tend to ride electric bikes more often then they do classical peddle bikes. Whereas annual members ride either bike at almost equal numbers.

Casual riders are also the only riders who use docked bikes.

### Where are Users Riding?

By cross referencing the starting latitude and longitude of each ride, we can determine which neighborhoods a ride took place.

Below is a summary of the top 10 neighborhoods favored by all member types.

At first glance it may seem like there is no difference, that casual riders and those with annual memberships tend to ride in the same areas, however upon closer inspection we can see that certain neighborhoods are favored more by annual members and some by casual riders. For example Steeterville is popular among both groups, but casual riders tend to ride there more than annual members.

By calculating and graphing the differences between these groups we should be able to identify trends in riding behavior.

| Neighborhood      | Member Rides  | Casual Rides  | Difference |
|-------------------|--------------:|--------------:|-----------:|
| West Loop         | 287350        | 129052        | 158298     |

![Neighborhoods more Casual Riders](/analysis/neighborhoods_by_more_casual.png)

| Neighborhood   | Member Rides  | Casual Rides  | Difference |
|----------------|--------------:|--------------:|-----------:|
| Museum Campus  | 18008         | 45370         | 27362      |
| Grant Park     | 32255         | 47651         | 15396      |

| Gage Park      | 2148          | 4849          | 2701       |

The areas with more annual members than casual riders tends to be more urban areas, while the areas with more casual riders than annual members tend to be areas with parks and other recreational attractions.

## Summary

From our analysis, we can make the following observations:

Annual Members:

* More often to ride during the week than the weekend.
* A significant number of riders ride during the winter.
* Take shorter rides than casual riders.
* Ride at equal frequency at morning or during the evening.
* Have no real preference for electric bikes or classical peddle bikes.
* Are more likely to ride in urban areas than casual riders.

Casual Riders:

* More likely to ride during the weekend.
* Unlikely to ride during the winter, preferring to ride during the warmer months.
* Takes longer rides than casual riders.
* Do not ride in the morning as often as they do in the evening.
* Prefer electric bikes over classic peddle bikes.
* Are more likely to ride in areas with parks or other recreational areas than annual members.

## Conclusion

There seems to be a trend for annual members to use Cyclistic bikes for their daily work commute. This is shown by their preference for using the bike during the week as opposed to the weekend, to more often use the bike in the winter than casual riders and are more likely to ride urban areas.

Alternatively, casual riders appear to use Cyclistic bikes for recreation. This is shown by preferring to ride during the weekend, during the warm summer months, and in areas with parks.

## Action to Take

To convert casual riders to annual members, a marketing campaign designed to attract people who use Cyclistic for recreational purposes could be affective. Possibly by targeting advertisements during the time of year when casual riders are more likely to be active and in areas where casual riders tend to ride.

Casual riders also prefer to ride electric bikes. A promotion offering exclusive access to electric bikes to annual members or other incentives related to electric bikes could be a good way to convert casual riders to annual members.

## Future Analysis

Our findings could be further enhanced by obtaining personal information on the riders themselves. Being able to determine if a user is a resident of Chicago or a tourist could be very useful information. A tourist who only uses Cyclistic while visiting is unlikely to sign up for an annual membership, so those users should be filtered out of our analysis.

By being able to identify which rides are taken by which users, we can better determine what "kind of riders" use Cyclistic services. For example, recreational areas are not exclusive to casual riders, many annual members also ride in those areas as well. By being able to identify a trends by users, we can get a better idea as to how Cyclistic bikes are being used by casual riders.
