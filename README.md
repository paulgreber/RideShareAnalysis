# RideShareAnalysis

## Introduction

This project contains all the analysis and supporting documents related to Case Study 1 of the Google Data Analytics course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/)

This exercise involves analyzing the data from Cyclistic, a bicycle ride-share service.

## Setup

The files required to perform the analysis can be found on this repository, and can be obtained by either manually downloading a copy or cloning it from Github.

Because of file size limits on Github, the data for this project has be compressed into multiple zip files. Extract the `data.zip.001` file to the `data` directory, this will also extract the content from the other zip files.

The software needed to actually perform the analysis is:

* Python 3.10.7 or higher
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Geopandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Case Study

An outline of the case study itself will be contained within `case_study.md`
